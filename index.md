# About
I am a Software Developer at [LawDepot](https://lawdepot.com/) where I worked with scrum teams to build modern products that help over 10 million users in 11 countries worldwide with accessible and affordable legal services. In this role, I lead by example, influence decision-making, effectively handle conflict, and be a champion for engineering best practices for well-tested, scalable, and well-organized code. 

I co-founded [Trigger Tracker](https://triggertracker.tech/) where we are revolutionizing the management of diet-restricting conditions such as IBD/IBS, Celiac, and food intolerances with a smart food diary app powered by Artificial Intelligence to warn users of potential trigger ingredients in their meal before they eat it! Iâ€™m currently in charge of designing and developing the product.

Outside of work, I would do Judo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, boxing, and bouldering.
